      >domx seeks to make <i>your</i> web components the core building blocks of
      <i>your</i> application by offering a clean way to manage them. The
      <code>dx-state</code> component is the only domx component you need to get
      started. However, domx offers a handful of simple stand-alone utility
      components that assist with commont needs like responsive layouts, tables,
      grids, tabs, text, etc.
